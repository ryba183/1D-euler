### 1D_euler solver ###

# Parameters are submitted via command line options.
# For parameter options type:
./1d_euler --help 

### To recombile source file ###

# Compile 1d_euler solver with optimisation level 3
make 1d_euler

# Combile 1d_euler with profilling enabled
make 1d_euler_pg

### iterate-euler.sh Bash script runs test case 2 with multiple ncells ###

# iterate-euler.sh runs test case 2 with a range of ncells to see how
# quickly the midpoint solution velocity approaches zero.
# The script also times each iteraction and output is written to stdout.
# Maybe this could be a good graph to include?
# An output of this can be found in the velocity test2 folder.  

# This runs using GNU parallel to run multiple copies at the same time.
# You may need to install GNG parallel and you can adjust the number 
# of copies run in parallel by editing the -j parameter in the .sh file. 
chmod u+x iterate-euler.sh
